![[Pasted image 20240401191548.png]]

### Preposiciones de tiempo y lugar de todo

La traducción más habitual de **la preposición _with_ es con**. Pero hay que tener en cuenta que la preposición _with_ en inglés **se utiliza para formar numerosos _phrasal verbs_**, y el uso de la preposición con un verbo hace que cambie el significado de ambas palabras.

Se usa "with" para expresar la causa o razón de algo.

Se utiliza "with" porque describe una sensación de satisfacción o contentamiento en relación con el sofá.


##### Verbos phrasales con with
**_As with_** _any town, there is a lot of gossip._ (así como sucede con)

**The Godfather**
My favorite movie is the Godfather. This crime drama, set in New York in 1945, is based on the novel written by Mario Puzo and was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The cast includes well-known stars such as Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Diane Keaton. The film has 2 sequels, the Godfather 2 and 3.

The plot tells the story of an Italian-American family involved in the mafia and follows the transformation of one of Vito Corleone’s children who is reluctant to participate in the family business at the beginning of the film. It has a brilliant soundtrack composed by Nino Rota.  

I like it because I think it’s a masterpiece since it combines a brilliant cast, soundtrack and plot. Indeed, it shows a fictional historical drama about a controversial matter such as mafias in the US in the early XIX century.
